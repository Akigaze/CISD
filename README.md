# CISD and CISD_loop v1.0
This is old version for CISD and CISD_loop, which uses SVM and only a few features to predict loops.
For latest version, please see the brance CISD_version_2.0. In version 2.0, 106 features(features from Hi-C contact index, FFT profiles and distance) and 4 models(Random Forest, GBDT, AdaBoost and ExtraTree) are used to predict loops, which greatly improves the arrcuracy of the prediction compared with version 1.0.
